#Hi, I'm Yain Neyestani
Welcome to my Github repository, it's a SVM, Decision Tree and RandomForest model repository

#About repository:
In this repository, I have placed the data used in the model training and the page of my jupyter notebook, which is the running code of the model training, and the steps are as follows:
-first import libraries
-Data analysis and Graphs
-function on which model is better
-improve the Decision Tree model & its score and accuracy & its confusion matrix
-improve the Random Forest model & its score and accuracy & its confusion matrix
-improve the SVM model & its score and accuracy & its confusion matrix

#About Dataset
-Context
Bob has started his own mobile company. He wants to give tough fight to big companies like Apple,Samsung etc.

He does not know how to estimate price of mobiles his company creates. In this competitive mobile phone market you cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem he collects sales data of mobile phones of various companies.

Bob wants to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM,Internal Memory etc) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Machine Learning. So he needs your help to solve this problem.

In this problem you do not have to predict actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is
